My name is Sakinovic Haris and currently I am last year student in Business Computing ( I am not sure is it real translation on englis. 
Since I am studying in Belgium on French language original title is: Informatique de gestion, or on German: Wirtschaftsinformatik).

I am studying, working and living in Belgium.

Before I moved to Belgium I finished University in my home country Bosnia and Hercegovine and I got Bachelor degree in International and
Public Relations.

Currently I am doing my internship in IT sector in on company in Belgium. I am working on one project using php and mySql. Project is about creating new modern ERP system for company. 


I am interested in mobile app developement what I learned by myself in free time but also I like backend-frontend developement. In school we worked with node.js, angular, php, c# .net freamwork. I am familier with TypeScript, JavaScript, Jave, PHP, Node.js, ExpressJS, Angular, MongoDB, SQL and  I am trying to expend my knowledge. I am currently learning React. 

I am fluent in English, German and French.

I would like to start with my first projects so if you have anything that I can do for you or could help you with, I will be more than thankful for that. 

Thank you
