My name is Sakinovic Haris and currently I am last year student in Business Computing ( I am not sure is it real translation on englis. 
Since I am studying in Belgium on French language original title is: Informatique de gestion, or on German: Wirtschaftsinformatik).

I am studying, working and living in Belgium.

Before I moved to Belgium I finished University in my home country Bosnia and Hercegovine and I got Bachelor degree in International and
Public Relations.

My current work doesnt have anything to do with public relations neither with IT but I hope that soon I will start to work in IT sector as developer because that is what I am enjoying to do, what I like to do and what I am dreaming to do. 

From september 2022 I will start with my Internship in one company where I will work on developing new solutions and maintaining current ones. 

I am interested in mobile app developement what I learned by myself in free time but also I like backend-frontend developement. 
In school we worked with springboot, node.js, angular, php, c# .net freamwork so I can say that I have basic knowledge that I am trying to expend. I am currently learning more about javascript and angular. In my free time I learned java and android app developement. Later on
I tried to learn Kotlin but did not have enough time so needed to stop.

I am fluent in English, German and French.

I would like to start with my first projects so if you have anything that someone like me could help you, I will be more than thankful for that. Offcours I would like to help for free just to gain experience and knowledge. 

Thank you
